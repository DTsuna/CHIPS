# Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS)

This is a tool for obtaining the whole history of the progenitors of
interaction-powered transients. Coupled with the MESA stellar evolution
code and several codes implemented by the authors, the user can obtain the
circumstellar matter profile and light curves of the interaction-powered
supernovae, for a selected mass and metallicity of the progenitor star.
